* HOW TO IMPORT IN ECLIPSE *
****************************

For up-to-date instructions, please see: http://pathvisio.org/wiki/EclipseSetup

*************************
* HOW TO BUILD WITH ANT *
*************************

Using the ant build file, you can build the project
from the command line. You can also use ant to generate
the apidocs and to create an executable jar.

It is also possible to set up eclipse to build ant targets.

First make sure ant is set up properly. It comes with eclipse, but you'll have
to check if the path is set correctly if you want to run it from the 
command line.

The ant build file provides the following targets, which you can invoke
it from the directory which contains build.xml with 
	ant <target>

where <target> is one of:

compile:   just compile all classes
docs:      generate all apidocs
jar:       generate executable jar file
clean:     remove all generated files
dist:      generate zip package and windows installer. 
           The zip package only includes files needed to *run* not compile.
all:       clean, then compile, jar, dist and docs.

********************************
* HOW TO RUN FROM THE TERMINAL *
********************************

If you have managed to build the classes with ant or with eclipse, you 
can use pathvisio.bat to start java from the command line.

**********************************
* HOW TO BUILD WINDOWS INSTALLER *
**********************************

With the ant target "dist", you generate a 
zip file and an automatic installer. These files are
put in the dist directory and include the revision nr. 
in the filename.

You need the following external tools: 

Inno-Setup
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
make sure "iscc.exe" is in your path.

svnversion.exe
This .exe comes with the windows version of svn (not TortoiseSvn)
http://subversion.tigris.org/
