== TODO & BUGS ==

HIGH PRIORITY

* Patch tool using Dgpml input, with adjustable fuzz factor

* Pathway.equals

* Make similarity function more flexible. There must be a minimum
  similarity. Can two different object types match? Should there be a
  priority score per Attribute?

* BUG: Line matching wrong when comparing Ach_synth.gpml version 2 and
  3. Need to score based on movement distance.

* BUG: Array out of bounds exception when comparing some pathways,
  e.g. Hs_Wnt... vs Hs_Wnt_modified or Ach_synth v3 vs v4.

* Yellow color not very visible, maybe use different color?

* Better hinting: CenterX, CenterY changed should be Position changed.

LOW PRIORITY

* add timing code

* Test with lot's of Biopax content (or maybe just ignore biopax content?)

* Test script, that takes any two similar pathways, compares them,
  creates a diff and then pathches both ways and see if you get the
  same thing back. Should run as an agent on wikipathways
  automatically.
