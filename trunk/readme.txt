* HOW TO BUILD WITH ANT *
*************************

Make sure ant is set up properly. It comes with eclipse, but you'll have
to check if the path is set correctly if you want to run it from the 
command line. Alternatively, you can run ant targets directly from eclipse.

The ant build file provides the following targets, which you can invoke
with 
	ant <target>
	
compile: just compile all classes
docs: generate all apidocs
jar: generate executable jar file
clean: remove all generated files
all: clean, then compile, jar and docs.
