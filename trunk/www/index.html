<h2>Program Overview</h2>
<p>
Gmml-Visio is a pathway visualization and editing program using pathways in the 
GMML format. It is meant to be flexible enough to display many different types of data, such as microarray data and 
proteomics data, on familiar biological pathways. 
The available GMML pathways are converted directly from GenMAPP pathways, and 
should appear exactly the same.
</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
This software is Beta and available only for testing purposes 
to members of NuGO, the Biorange Pathway group and the GenMAPP group.
Although we have done a lot of testing already, we can't guarantee
that it works for you or even that it doesn't blow up your computer.

About this help file...
</p>
<p>
As is always the case, this help page was one of the last 
features added to Gmml-Visio. As such, we must admit that 
the information here is scant.
We ask for your understanding and promise to work hard in the 
future to improve the situation.

<h2>How do I ... Create a new pathway</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new pathway by pressing Ctrl+N or going to File-&gt;New Mapp in 
the menu.
  </li>
  <li>Now you can start adding new elements and editting them. See How to... 
Edit a pathway below for more information. Note that when creating a new 
pathway, you automatically enter edit-mode.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
How do I ... Edit a pathway</h2>

<ol>
  <li>First, make sure you are in edit mode. You can toggle edit mode by 
pressing the edit-mode icon in the toolbar (at the top of the main window). The 
edit-mode icon looks like a little window with a pencil on top of it. 
Alternatively you can toggle edit-mode in the Edit menu.</li>
  <li>You can change existing objects in two ways. Firstly, you can click on 
an object and drag the handles to resize or move objects. Secondly, you can open 
the properties tab in the panel on the right size of the window. There you can 
enter exact coordinates, as well as all kinds of other object properties.</li>
  <li>You can add new objects by clicking one of the object icons in the 
toolbar. Note that the object icons are only available in edit-mode. If you're 
unsure what a certain icon does, you can hover over it with the mouse cursor to 
get a description.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
How do I ... Display microarray data</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Select the right gene database</li>
  <li>Make sure your expression dataset is in the right format. Your 
expression dataset needs to be in tab-delimited text format (which you can 
create in excel). Create an expression dataset. You can create the dataset in 
excel. You have to use the same layout as when importing data in GenMAPP, 
including the GenMAPP system code. Please refer to the GenMAPP manual how to do 
this.</li>
</ol>
<h2>
Keyboard shortcuts</h2>

<p>
Ctrl + N: create a new pathway<br>
Ctrl + O: open a pathway<br>
Ctrl + S: save pathway</p>
