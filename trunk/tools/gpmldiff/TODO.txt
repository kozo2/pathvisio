IMPORTANT

* Brace as Shape -> Highlighing of Brace is now merely a rectangle

* consistent naming: this vs other, doc1 vs doc2 ---> old vs new

* old and new headers in svg output (including filenames)

* Make similarity function more flexible. There must be a minimum
  similarity. Can two different object types match? Should there be a
  priority score per Attribute?

LATER

* add timing code

* Test with lot's of Biopax content (or maybe just ignore biopax content?)

* Patch tool using Dgpml input, with adjustable fuzz factor
