= Test procedure

test procedure: perform all these steps before a webstart release, and after making large changes that could have unintended consequences

== PathVisio 1.0 features

# open Hs_Apoptosis.gpml. 
# open human gene database. 
# Add a gene product. Link this gene product to Entrez Gene 3643 (INSR). Check that the backpage displays correctly
# Save to a temporary location
# import Hs_Apoptosis.mapp.
# Search pathways for occurences of TNF (Gene symbol). Click on one to open it.
# Search pathways for occurences of Entrez gene 3643 (Gene ID). Click one to open it.
# create a new pathway. 
# draw two geneproducts and a line between them. draw a circle and a tbar.
# link the two geneproducts with the line by using alt+click
# select everything by dragging. copy and paste
# select two gene products with shift-click and change their color property to blue
# select a circle, make its rim red and center yellow.
# change the shape type from circle to rect
# delete an object
# zoom to 200%
# zoom to fit
# undo until the pathway is emtpy and do the last steps agin
# save to a temporary location. Export to a .mapp. 
# Open the just created mapp in GenMAPP.
# Export to .svg. Export to .png. Check that both files can be opened
# Open the online help.
# Open the about box. Check if the revision nr. is correct

== packaging

# create the installer, and install it
# check the version nr. in the about box.

== PathVisio 2.0 features

# Go to data->create new expression data set
# go through the wizard to import data from example-data/sample_data_1.txt
# create a new visualization mapping from blue to yellow 
# open Hs_apoptosis pathway
# check that the sample data is visible on the pathway.

# select metabolite database hmdb.pgdb
# select gene database for human
# create a new pathway
# create a gene mapped to Entrez gene 3643, and check backpage (INSR)
# create a metabolite mapped to Cas 56-73-5, and check backpage (Glucose 6P)

# restart PathVisio
# open the gene expression dataset you just created
# check that the visualization you just created is available
# open Hs_Apoptosis again
