                           PathVisio project
lib/                     - contains the 5 external libraries

pathvisio.bat            - shortcut for running PathVisio from the command line.
                           note: this runs on the class files generated with ant.
readme.txt               - this file
build.xml                - ant build file (see below)
pathvisio.exe            - helper exe, checks for the presence of the 
                           java runtime environment and generates a helpful error
						   message if it isn't present. Otherwise, it starts the .jar
swt-win32-3139.dll       - dll required on windows for the swt library
SciTE.properties         - project file for the SciTE text editor.
                           ignore this if you're not using SciTE.
GPML.xsd                 - Latest version of the XML Schema used by PathVisio.
pathvisio.iss            - inno-setup script, to generate installer


****************************
* HOW TO IMPORT IN ECLIPSE *
****************************

After obtaining the source:

Open Eclipse
File->New->Project...
Java Project from existing Ant buildfile
select "build.xml" from the gmml-visio source tree

At this point the project will get imported and compiled. 
If you see a ton of errors, this is probably because you haven't enabled 
java 5.0 complicance. If this is the case, do

Project->Properties
Java Compiler
mark "enable project specific settings"
Set compiler compliance level to 5.0
Apply
The project gets rebuilt.

If you want to run the gmml-visio, you need to select gmmlVision.GmmlVision 
as the main class.

If you get FileNotFoundExceptions for things like images\mrna.bmp, this means that
the working directory is not set properly. Make sure the working directory is set to 
the top directory, i.e. the directory containing build.xml. 

*************************
* HOW TO BUILD WITH ANT *
*************************

Using the ant build file, you can build the project
from the command line. You can also use ant to generate
the apidocs and to create an executable jar.

It is also possible to set up eclipse to build ant targets.

First make sure ant is set up properly. It comes with eclipse, but you'll have
to check if the path is set correctly if you want to run it from the 
command line.

The ant build file provides the following targets, which you can invoke
it from the directory which contains build.xml with 
	ant <target>

where <target> is one of:

compile:   just compile all classes
docs:      generate all apidocs
jar:       generate executable jar file
clean:     remove all generated files
dist:      generate zip package and windows installer. 
           The zip package only includes files needed to *run* not compile.
all:       clean, then compile, jar, dist and docs.

********************************
* HOW TO RUN FROM THE TERMINAL *
********************************

If you have managed to build the classes with ant or with eclipse, you 
can use gmml-visio.bat to start java from the command line.

**********************************
* HOW TO BUILD WINDOWS INSTALLER *
**********************************

With the ant target "dist", you generate a 
zip file and an automatic installer. These files are
put in the dist directory and include the revision nr. 
in the filename.

You need the following external tools: 

Inno-Setup
http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
make sure "iscc.exe" is in your path.

svnversion.exe
This .exe comes with the windows version of svn (not TortoiseSvn)
http://subversion.tigris.org/
