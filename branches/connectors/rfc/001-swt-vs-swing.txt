Optie 1: Turn PathVisio into swing UI

+ better mac support

Optie 2: PathVisio remains swt UI

+ status quo
+ filedialog better integrated
- differences between wikipathways <-> pathvisio (case in point: literature search dialog)

Notes:
SwtCooker / SwingCooker may reduce some of the boring aspects of UI programming, this may make it easier to maintain two versions of the UI.
