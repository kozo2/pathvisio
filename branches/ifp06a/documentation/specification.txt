The goal of our final program is to be able to load gmml files into java, 
from there the program has to visualize the gmml files like genmapp files, 
but now it has to be possible to change the layout by dragging the elements. 
At the end of the program the changes have to be written back to gmml. 

A diagram below explains how the program will be constructed:

*	The gmml files will be loaded into java with the help of jdom 
	In java the same structure will be used as in gmml. 
	This will be done by a tree of else if statements. The tree will 
	correspond to the gmml structure. This way all the elements en attributes from gmml 
	can be loaded into java. The most important elements are the lines and the geneproducts. 

	-Hakim and Erik will work on this part.

*	From the loaded elements and attributes the program will create pictures that are similar 
	to the genmapp files but now the layout can be changed, by dragging elements with the 
	cursor. Then the result will be written back to gmml. 

	-Irene and Margriet will work on this part. 

*	As an extra possibility we will write an algorithm that will calculate an optimal layout based 
	on the lowest potential energy principle. This algorithm considers elements as point charges that 
	repulse each other. The lines will be considered as bonds that pulls the elements near each other. 

	-René will work on this part.
